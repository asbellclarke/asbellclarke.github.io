      <p class="clear">I am a senior researcher at TERC, a non-profit research and development organization focusing on innovative, technology-based math and science education. At TERC, I lead a team of designers, educators, and researchers who study inclusive STEM learning, particularly for neurodivergent learners. We study how theoretically and empirically grounded educational models in games, computational thinking, and mixed reality can be used as learning supports and assessments, particularly to reveal untapped knowledge of cognitively diverse learners.</p>

      <p>I started my career as an onboard software verification analyst for IBM during the first 25 missions of the space shuttle. Later I taught Math, Physics, and Astrophysics to some of the brightest students in the country at the laboratory school at University of Illinois. In 1993, I came to TERC and led several science education projects at TERC involving curriculum development, professional development of teachers, and educational research. In an effort to reach a more diverse audience of learners in 2009, I co- founded the Educational Gaming Environments group (EdGE) at TERC with my colleagues to study how game-based learning can transform STEM education. In 2023, I co-founded the Neurodiversity in STEM group at TERC and authored the book <em>Reaching and Teaching Neurodivergent Learners in STEM: Strategies for Embracing Uniquely Talented Problem Solvers</em> published by Routledge/Taylor&Francis.</p>

        <!-- INFACT is a consortium of leading researchers and practitioners in CT education. EdGE at TERC is leading the team in the design, development, implementation and research of a comprehensive set of teaching and learning materials for inclusive computational thinking. INFACT pays particular attention to the inclusion of a wide range of learners, including neurodiverse learners. INFACT recognizes that each learner brings a unique set of assets and deficits to every learning situation. -->

        <li>NSF/CSforALL/#1738574 &nbsp; <i>Personalized Computational Thinking for Grades 3-8</i> &nbsp; $996,360 (2018-2020)</li>

        <!-- The project conducted a multi-year longitudinal study of district students in grades 3- 8 to examine changes over time in their tool usage, CT self-efficacy, CT practices and its application in STEM and English Language Learning classes. This study is also surveyed district teachers about their CT instructional practices with survey questions aligned with the MA Digital Literacy and Computer Science standards. This information, combined with teacher participation in the CodePlay RPP and student demographics, was used to examine the impact of the CodePlay project on teacher instructional practices and student outcomes. -->

        <li>NSF/DRK12/#1502882 &nbsp; <i>Zoombinis: The Full Development Implementation Research Study of a Computational Thinking Game for Upper Elementary and Middle School Learners</i> &nbsp; $1,941,206 (2016-2019)</li>

        <!-- This project leveraged the existing logic puzzle game, Zoombinis, by embedding tools for studying patterns of students’ decision-making and problem-solving in the environment. This allowed researchers to understand how students learn about computational thinking within a tool that bridged informal and formal learning settings to engage a wide variety of students. Tools and resources for classroom teachers were developed. The goal was to understand both students’ learning of computational thinking and how to bridge formal and informal learning via classroom implementation of the Zoombinis game. -->
