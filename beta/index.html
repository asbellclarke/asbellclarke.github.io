      <h3>&ldquo;Nearly every neurodivergent STEM professional I speak with says they want autonomy and agency in the workplace. They want room to think about problems differently and agency to solve them in their own unique ways. This is how they thrive and this is how they are most productive. Their managers agree. I will help you design a work environment in which each of your team members can reach their highest potential.&rdquo;</h3>

      <h5>Dr. Jodi Asbell-Clarke is an experienced leader, researcher, and communicator who specializes in the inclusion of neurodivergent learners in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Jodi started her career as a computer programmer for IBM on the first 25 missions of NASA’s space shuttle program. She then went to graduate school for astrophysics with a dream of becoming an astronaut, but instead found her love for teaching and learning. She started teaching at the laboratory high school at the University of Illinois, and moved on to TERC, a non-profit in Cambridge, Mass focusing on educational research and innovations for equity in STEM education. For the past 30 years at TERC, Dr. Asbell-Clarke has led ground-breaking educational research on how educational technologies and innovative pedagogies—such as game-based learning, project-based learning, and computational thinking—can reach marginalized learners in STEM. Jodi has lived in the US, France, and Canada (she currently resides in Halifax, Nova Scotia), where she has worked side-by-side with educators, academics, and business leaders to understand the how to leverage and nurture the unique talents of neurodivergent learners in STEM.</h5>
