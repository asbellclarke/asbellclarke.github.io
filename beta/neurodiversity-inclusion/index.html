      <h5 class="clear">The natural human variation in brains means that we all learn, think, and differently. Some people's unique ways of processing may not be what school or the workplace is designed to support. By thinking about thinking, and about working and learning, differently - we can build environments and systems that help everyone thrive.</h5>

      <p>Some people with autism are exceptionally talented in detailed pattern recognition, systematic thinking, and other areas critically needed for a cyberscurity or AI workforce?</p>

      <p>Some people with ADHD are outstanding idea generators and score higher on creativity and divergent thinking tasks than non-ADHD folks.</p>

      <p>Neirodversity is so important to many STEM companies, they call it their competitive advantage.</p>

      <h5 class="clear text-center"><b>&ldquo;</b>Nearly every neurodivergent STEM professional I speak with says they want autonomy and agency in the workplace. They want room to think about problems differently and agency to solve them in their own unique ways. This is how they thrive and this is how they are most productive. Their managers agree. I will help you design a work environment in which each of your team members can reach their highest potential.<b>&rdquo;</b></h5>
