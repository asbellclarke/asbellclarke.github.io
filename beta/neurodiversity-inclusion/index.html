      <h5>Top companies around the world lare increasingly looking to neurodiversity for a competitive advantage. They have discovered that some of the most creative, systematic, focused, innovative, and persistent  members of their workforce are autistic or have ADHD or dyslexia or more than one of these. They realize that it is not despite their differences that these employees excel, it is because of their neurodiversity.</h5>

      <p>Is it simple to change hiring and management practices to be more inclusive of neurodiversity? No. But it is doable. It's being done. And it is paying off in all kinds of ways. Let us help you and your organization open the doors to neurodivergent employees. We will work together to help you create an inclusive environment with structures that help neurodivergent thinkers thrive. You may just find the changes make a better workplace for everyone.</p>

    <div class="grid grid-right">

      <h5 class="clear"><b>&ldquo;</b><i>Nearly every neurodivergent STEM professional I speak with says they want autonomy and agency in the workplace. They want room to think about problems differently and agency to solve them in their own unique ways. This is how they thrive and this is how they are most productive. Their managers agree. I will help you design a work environment in which each of your team members can reach their highest potential.</i><b>&rdquo;</b></h5>

      <h3 class="clear title">What is neurodiversity?</h3>

      <h5>The natural human variation in brains means that we all learn, think, and differently. Some people's unique ways of processing may not be what school or the workplace is designed to support. By thinking about thinking, and about working and learning, differently - we can build environments and systems that help everyone thrive.</h5>

      <p>Some people with autism are exceptionally talented in detailed pattern recognition, systematic thinking, and other areas critically needed for a cyberscurity or AI workforce?</p>

      <p>Some people with ADHD are outstanding idea generators and score higher on creativity and divergent thinking tasks than non-ADHD folks.</p>

      <p>Neirodversity is so important to many STEM companies, they call it their competitive advantage.</p>
